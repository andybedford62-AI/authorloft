# AuthorLoft — Changelog

Internal record of features shipped, newest first. This is the engineering/product
log; the **customer-facing** version lives on the public News page (`/news`).

AuthorLoft is continuously deployed (dev → staging → prod), so there are no formal
version numbers — entries are grouped by date. Dates from May 20, 2026 onward are
sourced from git commit history; earlier milestones come from project records.

**How to maintain:** when you ship something noteworthy, add a bullet under today's
date (create a new date heading if needed). Roll big efforts up into one feature
line rather than listing every commit.

## June 12, 2026 — Mobile Layout Fixes
_(promoted to prod June 12, 2026)_
- **Homepage mobile overflow fix** — the desktop nav-links pill on the homepage hero had an inline `display: flex` that overrode its `hidden md:flex` class, forcing it to render on mobile and pushing the page ~106px past the viewport edge (hiding the mobile menu button off-screen). Removed the inline override so it's hidden below the `md` breakpoint as intended
- **Resources page mobile overflow fix** — the partner-resource card grid's `minmax(320px, 1fr)` columns overflowed narrow viewports; changed to `minmax(min(320px, 100%), 1fr)` so cards never exceed the available width
- **Homepage FAQ section mobile fix** — the FAQ section's two-column grid (`1fr 1.4fr`, intro + accordion) didn't collapse on mobile, cutting off the entire accordion column off-screen; added a `max-width: 860px` media query that stacks it to a single column, reduces section padding, and un-stickies the intro
- **Homepage testimonials mobile fix** — the secondary-testimonial-card grid (`repeat(n, 1fr)`, n≥2) didn't collapse on mobile, pushing cards past the viewport edge; added a media query collapsing it to a single column, reducing section padding, and tightening the lead-testimonial card padding
- **Sitewide grid-overflow fix** — every `minmax(Npx, 1fr)` card/feature grid on the homepage (author showcase, problem/steps/features/genres/blog sections), the pricing section, and the resources page (partner tools + free downloads) had a fixed minimum column width wider than the available space inside a `60px`-padded section on a 375px screen, causing horizontal overflow; changed all of them to `minmax(min(Npx, 100%), 1fr)` so columns never exceed the viewport
- Also restyled blog/news thumbnails to 16:9, hid the bookstore hero social row, and restyled the News filter toolbar to match the Blog page (small follow-ups from the Blog redesign work below)

## June 12, 2026 — Blog Redesign, Content Categories Cleanup
_(promoted to prod June 12, 2026)_
- **Blog index redesign** ("The Loft Journal") — `/blog` now uses an editorial 3-column card grid with category tabs, search + sort toolbar (newest/oldest/quickest/longest/A-Z), and navy/gold placeholder plates for posts without a cover image; replaces the old uneven featured-post layout (`/news` is unaffected)
- **Content Categories: News type + strict dropdowns** — added a 4th "News" tab to Content Categories so News posts get their own managed, A-Z category list separate from Blog; the Blog/News post editor's Category field is now a strict dropdown (sourced from active Content Categories, A-Z, switches list when toggling Blog/News) instead of free-text + hardcoded suggestions; FAQ admin category dropdown now only shows active categories in A-Z order; Resources and Resource Downloads admin category dropdowns now A-Z ordered too

## June 12, 2026 — Author Empowerment Sprint 1: Pre-orders, Affiliate Program, Media Kit PDF
_(promoted to prod June 12, 2026)_
- **Pre-orders / "Coming Soon"** (STANDARD+, new `pre-orders` feature gate, default ON for Standard/Premium) — books can be marked "Coming Soon" with an optional launch date (Book edit → Organisation). The public book page shows a "Notify Me" signup form instead of buy buttons until launch. Author sees signup count under Organisation and can send a one-click "Send Launch Email" to everyone who signed up (`PreOrderSignup` table, `sendPreOrderLaunchEmail`)
- **Affiliate / Referral Program** (Direct Sales required) — new "Affiliate" tab on each book lets authors enable referral links with a configurable commission (1–50%). Authors generate labeled `?ref=CODE` links; clicks are tracked automatically (`AffiliateReferral` table), and a completed Stripe sale through a referral link credits the referrer's click/sale/earnings counters via the checkout cookie + webhook attribution
- **Media Kit PDF** — `/admin/media-kit` now has a "Download PDF" button that generates a one-page press kit (bio, photo, key stats: published books, newsletter subscribers, avg rating, books sold, top genres, featured book covers) via `@react-pdf/renderer` (serverless-safe, no headless browser)
- **Public Media Kit downloads** — the author site's `/media-kit` page now has a "Download Full Media Kit (PDF)" button (public version of the admin PDF, `/api/author-site/media-kit/pdf`) and a "Download Biography (.txt)" button next to the press bio (`/api/author-site/media-kit/bio`)
- **"Coming Soon" badge fix + extension** — the caption/badge ("New Release!", "Coming Soon!", etc.) was missing from the Bold template's "More Books" grid and from the Grid/Shelf books-page layouts; now shown consistently everywhere. Pre-order books (`isPreOrder`) without a custom caption now automatically show a "Coming Soon" badge across the author site (home, books page, carousels) and on `/bookstore` cards
- **FAQ nav link** — added a direct "FAQ" link to the marketing site's top nav and mobile menu (previously only inside the "Resources ▾" dropdown)
- **"Your Site Pages" dashboard card** — admin dashboard now shows a visual list of the author's live public pages (Home, Books, About, Contact, custom pages, etc., based on nav settings) as clickable links to the live site

## June 11, 2026 — FAQ, Content Categories, Downloadable Resources, Security, Feature Gates, CSV Import
_(promoted to prod June 12, 2026)_
- **Public FAQ page** (`/faq`) grouped by category with FAQ structured data; homepage FAQ capped at 10 with a "See all FAQs" link; added to sitemap
- **Content Categories** — shared category system (blog / resource / faq) with a Super-Admin CRUD panel; dynamic category dropdowns wired into the Blog, Resources, and FAQ editors (replaces hardcoded lists)
- **Email-gated downloadable resources** — Super-Admin "Resource Downloads" CRUD (cover, RTE detail body, category, publish/email-gate toggles); public "Free Downloads" section on `/resources` grouped by category; secure proxy (`/api/downloads/[id]`) hides the raw file URL + counts downloads; one-time email gate (`al_download_unlock` cookie) captures a lead; recent-leads list in admin
- **FREE plan upgrades** — Newsletter (capture + send) and AuthorLoft Bookstore listing moved to FREE via Feature Gates (super-admin can re-tier either at any time); new `bookstore-listing` gate replaces the hardcoded STANDARD+ check
- **CSV Book Import** (`/admin/books/import`) — 4-step wizard (Upload → Map Columns → Preview → Done) for migrating authors. Auto-detects a Goodreads "Export Library" CSV or our downloadable template; column mapper for anything else. Optional "Fill missing details from ISBN" enrichment (Google Books → Open Library). Genres/Series auto-created on match; imports land as drafts for review; respects plan book limits (imports up to the remaining slots, reports the rest as skipped with an upgrade prompt)
- **"Resources ▾" nav dropdown** — groups Blog, News, FAQ, and the relabeled "Tools & Communities" directory (hero + marketing nav, desktop + mobile); declutters the top nav
- **Rich-text FAQ answers** (Tiptap) + scrollable FAQ admin modal
- **Full-image covers** — blog headers, bookstore cards, and the Cinematic featured cover now use `object-contain` (whole image shows, no edge cropping)
- **Cinematic template** — featured release cover is now a link to the book detail page with a hover zoom + accent glow
- Marketing hero subhead copy refresh
- **Security** — chose Vercel Pro Firewall over Cloudflare (DNS stays on Vercel, no migration risk): Bot Protection on + custom rate-limit rules on auth/lead/API endpoints; Cloudflare deferred unless bots persist
