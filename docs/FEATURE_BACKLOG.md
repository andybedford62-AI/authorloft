# AuthorLoft — Feature Backlog

Running list of ideas and enhancements to consider for future builds. Not committed work — a parking lot for "next features." Pull items from here when planning a session; move shipped items to the bottom (or delete).

**How to use:** add new ideas under the right area with a one-line rationale and a rough effort/impact note. Keep it scannable.

_Last cleaned: June 11, 2026._

## Bookstore (`/bookstore`)

Shipped June 6, 2026 (discovery catalog, opt-in per book, STANDARD+). Hero/header redesigned June 8. Open ideas:

- [ ] **Author Spotlight curation** — currently auto-rotates daily among authors with a photo + bio. Options: super-admin hand-pick, or make it **Premium-only** as an upgrade incentive. *(small–medium)*
- [x] **Verify "Trending Now" view data** — was broken: `Book.views` was never incremented, so the row never showed. Fixed June 14, 2026 by adding a view increment on author book-page visits. *(done)*
- [ ] **Reader accounts + favorites/wishlists** — let readers save books. Powerful but heavy (no reader auth today). *(large)*
- [ ] **Curated "Staff Picks" / collections** — super-admin curation UI for themed shelves. *(medium)*
- [ ] **Quick-view modal** — peek at a book without leaving the bookstore. *(small)*
- [ ] **Bookstore listing limits by tier** — e.g., STANDARD limited number of listings, PREMIUM unlimited + featured (pricing lever). *(small)*
- [ ] **Clickable author name on book cards** — whole card currently links to the book (can't nest links); restructure so the author name links to their site separately. *(small)*
- [x] **Unify genre-page headers** — shipped June 15, 2026; `/bookstore/genre/[slug]` now uses the shared `MarketingPageHeader` brand band (same banner as the main Bookstore page) with an "All books" breadcrumb. *(done)*
- [ ] **Post-launch QA pass** — log in as a FREE author (confirm locked toggle) and approve a reader rating (confirm stars render on a card). *(verify)*

## AuthorLoft News (`/news`) — Phase 2 (email)

Shipped Phase 1 June 8, 2026 (public news archive, Blog/News CMS toggle, subscriber capture, search/filter). Deferred — see `docs/NEWSLETTER_PHASE2_PLAN.md`:

- [ ] **Email a news issue to subscribers** — compose + send to `PlatformSubscriber`s, reusing the broadcast/mass-email infra. *(medium)*
- [ ] **Double opt-in confirmation emails** + public unsubscribe page (`unsubscribeToken` already stored). *(small–medium)*
- [ ] **"Publish News post → also email subscribers"** one-click option. *(small)*
- [x] **RSS feed** for the news archive — shipped June 14, 2026 (`/news/rss.xml`, advertised via alternate link on `/news`). *(done)*
- [ ] **"New books this week" digest** — reader newsletter from the bookstore catalog; reuses the same email infra once Phase 2 lands. *(medium)*

---

## Author Empowerment — Pre-orders, Affiliate, Media Kit

Sprint 1 shipped June 12, 2026 (see Shipped section). Open follow-ons:

- [ ] **Auto-send pre-order launch email** — currently a manual "Send Launch Email" button on the book's Organisation tab; add a daily cron (`/api/cron/...`) that auto-sends when `preOrderDate` has passed and `isPreOrder` is still true (then flips `isPreOrder` off). *(small)*
- [ ] **Reader-facing affiliate dashboard** — referral links/stats are currently author-only (no reader accounts exist). A magic-link or email-based portal for promoters to see their own clicks/earnings is a larger lift requiring reader auth. *(large)*
- [ ] **Affiliate payouts** — earnings accrue in `AffiliateReferral.earningsCents` but there's no payout mechanism yet (Stripe Connect transfer or manual "mark as paid"). *(medium)*
- [ ] **Media Kit PDF — sales trend chart** — current PDF shows point-in-time stats; a 6-month sales trend sparkline would need chart-to-image rendering compatible with `@react-pdf/renderer`. *(medium)*

---

## Content Import (authors migrating in)

Shipped June 11, 2026 (Books CSV import — see Shipped section). Open ideas:

- [ ] **WordPress XML import** for blog posts + books. *(~5 days)*
- [ ] **Saved column-mapping presets** — let an author save a custom mapping for re-use on a second CSV from the same source. *(small)*

---

## Auth / Account

- [ ] **"Remember me" / login persistence** — login is a persistent ~30-day cookie, so closing the browser doesn't sign out (standard, not a security bug). Add a "Remember me" checkbox (checked = ~30d persistent; unchecked = session cookie). Optionally shorten default 30d → 7d. *(small–medium, touches NextAuth session/cookie config)*

---

## Marketing & SEO

- [ ] **Feature landing pages** — deferred until PostHog traffic data (~2026-07-01).
- [ ] **Marketing blog** content build-out — CMS exists; expand published content. *(~16 hrs content)*

---

## Resources & Downloads (`/resources`)

Shipped June 11, 2026 (email-gated downloadable resources alongside the affiliate directory). Open ideas:

- [ ] **Individual download detail pages** (`/resources/[slug]`) — render each download's RTE `body` as its own SEO landing page (currently downloads are cards only; the `body` field is captured but not surfaced publicly). Would also add per-download sitemap entries. *(small–medium)*
- [ ] **Email the download file** in addition to the instant link — reuse the broadcast/mass-email infra so the lead has a copy. *(small)*
- [ ] **Move gated files to Supabase signed URLs** (like orders/ARC downloads) if stronger control than hidden Drive links is needed later. *(medium)*
- [x] **Resources dropdown child label** — confirmed "Tools & Communities" matches the page content (tools, communities, organisations); keeping as-is. *(June 12, 2026)*
